## ABOUT

IOT Socket Server handle multiple clients (with unique deviceID and its key) simultaneously for bidirectional communication.
It is similar to WebSocket. Here we can handle each client individually from there device id.

IOT devices like Raspberry can also use this module as client with IOTSocketClient module.


**How is it secured ?**

To prevent Replay attacks and device cloning attacks.

For every data transmission from client to server or vice versa there is a time stamp which is compared with server/client present time. If the time doesn't match (tolerance of -2 sec) or if there is any reused time then socket is closed.

By using these headers for every transmission, IOT devices over WiFi can also be secured.

*NOTE:*
- Make sure the device time is in sync with server time (use RTC)
- Re-establish client socket connection every 24 hours
- SSL key pinning on client-side.
- Verify device id and key from database
- Client socket will be closed if there is no data for 90 sec

### Installation
You can install IOTSocket by running the following command
```
pip install IOTSocket
```
### Example Server
```python

### Example client
```python

'''

from IOTSocket import IOTSocketClient as sock

        clrprint(f"\nEstablishing socket connection to {host}:{port}",clr='y')
        sock.connectionSet(host,port,device_id,device_key,Encrypt=False, cert_path= certfile_path)  # set IOT Socket connection with valid Device ID and Key.
        # Continuously check for receiving / transmitting of data
        clrprint(f"Connection established successfully",clr='g')
        while 1:
            data = someThingtoSend()
            if data != '':
                sock.sendData(data)     # send data to server if data is available to send
            rcv_data = sock.recvData()  # receive data from server if available
            if len(rcv_data) > 5:
                handleCmdsFromServer(rcv_data)   # handle your data here

    except Exception as n:
        clr = 'r' if "ERROR:" in str(n) else 'y'
        clrprint(n,clr='r')
        clrprint('closing socket',clr='y')      
        try:
            sock.sock.close()
        except:
            pass
        time.sleep(10)
        

```

### Additional Information

The connection is established directly on 1st request from client. Make sure the client and server time are in sync.

Read/Write to your application from using fifo named pipe recursively without closing. 

Please go through the code for better understanding of the protocol.
